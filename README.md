# Gaggle

Rate movies and other things with people you actually know

##Don't just trust random trolls on the internet!

Look, online ratings from strangers just doesn't cut it. There are people with terrible taste, fake profiles written by people with hidden agendas and so on. Why would you trust their opinion on anything? Check ratings on things you like only from people you know and trust. Sure, maybe your mom has terrible taste, but it's still good to get her input on some things.
